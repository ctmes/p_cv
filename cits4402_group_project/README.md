### Aim
The aim of the project is to re-implement an automatic calibration procedure previously developed by a UWA PhD student for a holographic acquisition rig. The rig is composed of several cameras designed to reconstruct an item in 3D space from multiple points of view. To properly align the different images from these perspectives, the rig must be properly calibrated. This is the procedure that will be re-implemented, trained upon recognition of hexagonal targets.
